## Technology

In the development of the application, Unity is used with C#. The Unity Asset Store offers a wide range of ready-made assets, such as 3D models and plugins, which streamline the development process. To enable real-time hand tracking and accessory placement, the project integrates MediaPipe, a framework by Google that ensures smooth implementation of hand landmark detection, allowing for dynamic and realistic virtual try-ons.
